## PHP implement binary tree, add algebraic expression to binary tree, traverse the tree

In this example we will implement a binary tree and create a custom binary tree from algebraic expression without 
any special parser. We will simply manually insert all needed nodes to the tree. This is of course a brute force method, 
but it still works for this demo ðŸ™‚

So here is our algebraic expression to create binary tree from + visual binary tree representation for given 
algebraic expression:

And actual implementation of a binary tree for our algebraic expression is provided in binary_tree_traversal.php
