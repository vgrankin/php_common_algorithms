## PHP graph depth first search, breadth first search, incidence list, traversing the graph using PHP

There are times when you need non-linear data structure such as graph, and you also need some tools to go through each 
and every vertex of the graph. Here is a PHP implementation of the graph using incidence list (there is also incidence 
matrix or adjacency matrix to do just that, but we will stay with a list for now). Also methods are provided for 
depth-first search and breadth-first search algorithms.

Here is a graph we will program in graph_traversal.php:
